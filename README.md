# CP-Template

My personal C++ CP template

This contains a lot of useful shortenings, code snippets, type definitions, and driver code for improving times in competitive programming.

In particular, it focuses on just letting a competitive programmer (experienced or aspiring) write the logic to solve their problem, without fiddling with the code too much in a nonproductive manner.

Very nice.
